<h1>Aimhub - Game Launcher</h1>
<p>Aimhub is a game launcher application that hosts three different aim trainers where esports players can develop in-game aim mechanics such as reflexes, muscle memory, reaction time, and mouse movement. The front-end of the application was developed with React.js, React Router, React class components, and HTML/CSS. This project is still in production. Currently I am working on integrating a back-end to have user authentication and score tracking for all the different games.</p>
